Quantitative Reasoning Reflection

The main way I tested the accuracy of my code was by utilizing my "Terminal"
to see if it would run in the first place. Often times it didn't so I would try
to see what line wasn't working and fix it. In Lab 8 with the game I debugged
some of my syntax and the window opened but I couldn't move my sprite, so then I
knew to go to my on_key_press and see what is the hold up.







4.)
The limitations to using numerical methods to make decision is that they are
black and white. They do not account for the grey areas in between; these
hard lines they draw make it so that there is a lot of things that go
unaccounted for. Algorithms are not always right, you mentioned being on one
side of the political spectrum and getting content for that viewpoint, but I
consistently get propaganda to my opposing views. I find it funny to go into
the comment section and read all the ignorance and what I define as stupidity
in them, and so I get more political propaganda that goes against my own views.

Evaluating students based solely on metrics would be a gross simplification
of that person. Some people study hard and still fail, some don't study and
score well. To only look at the results ignores the processes students took to
get there, and the material learned in class is important but the skills and
methods they used to try to learn are things that can be applied to every facet
of their lives in the future. As for teachers, they can't force a student to
learn or put in the work. There has to be some sort of metrics to measure a
student's growth and if they simply just don't do those things the professor
can't make them and that is not their fault. Limiting athletes to only their
stats goes similarly with evaluating students, it is not always the end result
that matters. With sports though, there is also someone actively trying to stop
you and if you are both even in skill then your success rate for a game will
likely be around 50%.
